My First Almost Optional Website (Bootstrap + PHP + Mysql)
I spent around a month wiriting this code, most of this is written by me but several parts (mostly frontend) are from Web.
It doesn't have a propper order-payment-send to DB code or an admin panel since it's better done in a framework (my next goal).
